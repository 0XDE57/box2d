# Box2D 

**Box2D is a 2D physics engine for games.**

For help with Box2D, please visit http://www.box2d.org. There is a forum there where you may post your questions.

Please see `Building.txt` to learn how to build Box2D and run the testbed.

To run the demos, set `Testbed` as your startup project and press <kbd>F5</kbd>. Some test bed commands are:

- <kbd>r</kbd> to reset the current test
- <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to launch a bomb
- <kbd>&larr;</kbd> <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys to pan
- <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd> to zoom in/out
- use the mouse to click and drag objects

Please do not submit pull requests with new features. Instead, please file an issue first for discussion. For bugs, I prefer detailed bug reports over pull requests.
